# Welcome to the ceusdl VS Code Extension

The ceusdl extension for Visual Studio Code supports simple syntax highlighting for ceusdl code files.
This will be helpful for the efficient reading of your code. 

There are no features other then syntax highlighting within the extension until now. 

## Installing your extension locally

To install the ceusdl extension on your host, please copy the content of the folder Plugin to
your visual studio code extensions directory.

Windows: %USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions
macOS/Linux: $HOME/.vscode/extensions

After copying you should have a new folder

\[SYSTEM_DEPENDENT\]/.vscode/extensions/ceusdl

containing the ceusdl extension. After that, restart your visual studio code and open a ceusdl file. 
Now you should see the files content with a colorful syntax highlighting.
